/**

 * @author Programming II Teaching Team
 * @date 6 April 2020
 * @brief Public interface for a Linked List implementation.
 *
 * The List admits arbitrary elements, received as pointers to void. It is
 * necessary to provide functions to free, copy and print an element,
 * and a function to compare two elements when
 * creating the List (see documentation).
 *
 * This List implementation currently provides the following functionality:
 *
 * - Create and destroy a List.
 * - Check if a List is empty.
 * - Push an element into the front or back positions.
 * - Push an element in an ordered list.
 * - Pop an element from the front or back positions.
 * - Get the number of elements in a List.
 * - Get the element that occupies the i-position.
 * - Search an element in the list
 * - Print a List.
 *
 * Other desired funtionality not yet implemented includes:
 *
 * - Accessing the front and back elements without extracting them.
 * - Inserting to and extracting from arbitrary positions.
