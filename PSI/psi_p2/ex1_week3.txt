• What would happen if you don’t enter in a category name on the add category form?
	If you do not enter a cateory name on the add category form when clicking "Add New Category" it says to you that you have to add a name to the field.

• What happens when you try to add a category that already exists?
	It does not allow you because the name has to be unique.

• What happens when you visit a category that does not exist?
	It says that the category does not exists and shows you a link to go back to the index.

• In the section above where we implemented our ModelForm classes, we repeated the max_length values for fields that we had previously defined in the models chapter.
This is bad practice as we are repeating ourselves! How can you refactor your code so that you are not repeating the max_length values?
	We could pass as an argument the "max_length" field from the Category class to the CategoryForm class or make "max_length" visible to the class that inherit from the Category field.
